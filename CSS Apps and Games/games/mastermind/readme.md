# Mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two people (although this CSS version is only one player vs the machine). There is a _random_ code with 4 colors that the user needs to guess in less than ten attempts. After each attempt, some white and black dots will inform of how close it was: a white button indicates that one of the colors is in the code, but not in the position it was placed. A black button indicates that one of the colors is in the right position. No button, means that a color is not part of the code.
