# Plankman

Plankman is a pirate version of the classic game Hangman, in which a player needs to guess a word or sentence (in this case a movie title.) Try to guess the movie before our young pirate walks the plank and gets eaten by a shark!

*Beware*: activating the animations may incur in some CPU usage.
