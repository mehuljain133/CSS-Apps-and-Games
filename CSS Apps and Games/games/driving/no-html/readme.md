# CSS Driving

Driving is a racing game in which you need to avoid all the obstacles (aka grease stains) while remaining on the road. If you go over the grease patches or leave the road, the game will be over and you'll need to mouse out and back into the main frame.

**IMPORTANT**: WebKit browsers seem to have issues animating large elements with transformations, this demo looks and playes better in Firefox.
