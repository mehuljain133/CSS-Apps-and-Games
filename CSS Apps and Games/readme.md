# CSS Apps and Games

A collection of mini-apps and games developed on CSS and HTML, without using any JavaScript

## Project

The project is divided in two parts: games and apps, both of them have their own folder. Inside each of them,
the different games and apps are organized alphabetically (notice that there may be multiple versions).

The code is in those folders, the links below are to live demos on CodePen. You can see many of them in a
[CodePen Collection](https://codepen.io/collection/nvJYmm/).
