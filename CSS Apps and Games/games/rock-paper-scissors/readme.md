# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game: pick rock, paper, or scissors, and see if you can beat a _random_ selection from the computer. Remember: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

This is an interesting demo because it also includes the concept of pseudo-randomness in CSS.
