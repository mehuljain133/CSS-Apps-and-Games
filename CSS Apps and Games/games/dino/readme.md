# CSS Dino

A version of the no-internet-connection game on Chrome, done with HTML and CSS. Click on the dinosaur before reaching the cacti, to jump over them and get to the end of the path.

> Unfortunately, it uses CSS animations to change the values of some CSS variables and that seem to cause problems in non-Chromium browsers :(

No dinosaurs were harmed in the development of this game. Neither was any JavaScript code, image, or cactus... because none was used!
